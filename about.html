    <h2>Typefaces</h2>
    Typeface design is a fascinating skill-set with a ton of heritage, so Gruv Poole has included dedicated typefaces. <a href="https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html">Jost</a> was chosen for the body font and <a href="https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro">Office Code Pro</a> for the code snippets.
    They are both licensed under the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>and their licenses can be found <a href='/assets/fonts/body/LICENSE.md'>here</a> and <a href='assets/fonts/code/LICENSE.md'>here</a>.
