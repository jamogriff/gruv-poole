# Gruv Poole

Gruv Poole is a fork of the [Poole theme](https://github.com/poole/poole) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.

Poole's bones serve as the foundation, and Gruv Poole revamps the muscle, connective tissue and skin:
- implements the retro groove color palette from the Vim [Gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- complies with the [WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standard](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag)
- adds dedicated [open source typefaces](#licenses)
- adds a responsive two-column [home layout](#home-page-content) with overridable main content and social links
- adds ability to add a few [nav items](#masthead-navigation) to masthead
- trims plugin fat and refactors stylesheets to be more focused

Gruv Poole still aims to adhere to [@mdo's](https://github.com/mdo) philosophy of the original theme:
> [To] provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

## Usage

### Install as a Gem

The Gruv Poole theme was intended to be distributed as a [Ruby Gem for Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes).
In your Jekyll site's code, add the following to your Gemfile:
`gem "jekyll-theme-gruv-poole"`

Add the following line to your site's `_config.yml`:
```yaml
theme: gruv-poole
```

Ensure that you have your `_config.yml` with the data needed to build the theme (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)) and then run `bundle` and `jekyll s`.

### Hacking on theme code

Feel free to tweak this theme to your liking. Pay attention to the `.ruby-version` file for what version of Ruby to use-- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is recommended for Ruby development.

Once Ruby version is set, then run `bundle install` and then `bundle exec jekyll s` to build and serve the demo theme site. Please note that you likely will need to populate your `_config.yml` with required fields (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)).
Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.

For further resources (e.g. hosting free site on GitHub Pages, etc) see the original [Poole theme's documentation](https://github.com/poole/poole).

## Theme Overview

### Site structure (HTML)

The files within the `_layouts` directory define the HTML structure of pages and posts on the site. `_layouts/base.html` is the base HTML of the theme, which all other layouts should extend from.

Re-usable snippets of HTML code--also known as partials-- are placed in the `_includes` directory. 

### Site styling (Sass/CSS)

All of the site's styling resides in the `_sass` directory. The most noteworthy being `_variables.scss`, where CSS variables can be quickly tweaked to change the look and feel of the theme.

The theme's main style file that ultimately gets imported to the site's base HTML layout is `/assets/main.scss`. This `main.scss` file imports all of the Sass files in the `_sass` directory and Jekyll's Sass compilation outputs a single `main.css` similar to Webpack.

### Plugins

Gruv Poole comes packaged with [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag#usage), which ensures your website gets the most useful meta tags.


## Configuration Options

### Home page content

Gruv Poole's home page layout features an abbreviated about section with social links and a main content area.

#### About section

Populate the following properties in your `_config.yml` file to configure content for this section:
```yaml
about:
  # Required
  name: Example name
  # Required
  description: Example description for the site
  # Optional. If not present, then site tagline is displayed
  image: assets/example.jpeg
  # Optional
  # You can add more links here, but icons are only available
  # for these platforms specifically
  socials:
    - { id: github, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: youtube, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: linkedin, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: facebook, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: instagram, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: reddit, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: tiktok, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
    - { id: x, url: https://github.com/jamogriff }
```

#### Main section

By default a post archive is displayed as the main content, but this can easily be overridden to be anything you want. To override this content you can add whatever HTML you want in `index.html`.

### Masthead navigation

In your `_config.yml` you may add a couple of pages to be displayed as links in the navbar section of the site's masthead:
```yaml
masthead_pages:
  - about.md
```

### Google Analytics

To enable Google Analytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```
Gruv Poole includes a dynamic privacy policy page (`/privacy-policy`), and will display a privacy policy dependant on whether Google Analytics is enabled.

Note that Google Analytics will only be enabled in production (i.e. adding `JEKYLL_ENV=production` [when building](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/environments/) the site).

### RSS

Gruv Poole includes an RSS feed by default (`atom.xml`). If you'd like to advertise your RSS feed you can add `advertise_rss: true` to your config file and a link will be shown in the social links section on the home page.
