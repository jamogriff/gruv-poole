Gruv Poole is a fork of the [Poole theme](https://github.com/poole/poole) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.

Poole's bones serve as the foundation, and Gruv Poole revamps the muscle, connective tissue and skin:
- implements the retro groove color palette from the Vim [Gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- complies with the [WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standard](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag)
- adds dedicated [open source typefaces](#licenses)
- adds a responsive two-column [home layout](#home-page-content) with overridable main content and social links
- adds ability to add a few [nav items](#masthead-navigation) to masthead
- trims plugin fat and refactors stylesheets to be more focused

Gruv Poole still aims to adhere to [@mdo's philosophy](https://github.com/mdo) of the original theme:
> [To] provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

* Mobile friendly design and development
