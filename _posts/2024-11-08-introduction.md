*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel's supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll's loyal butler...

... Gruv Poole, on the other hand, is Poole's artisan brother who moved to Hawaii and embodies the shaka life &#129305;

Gruv Poole is a fork of the [Poole theme](https://github.com/poole/poole) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. Gruv Poole's philosophy remains unchanged from [@mdo's](https://markdotto.com/) original theme:
> Provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

Gruv Poole rebuilt Poole's color scheme to implement [Gruvbox's](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color palette.

## What's included

Gruv Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Gruv Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ '404.html' | relative_url }}), [RSS feed]({{ 'atom.xml' | relative_url }}), posts, [archive page]({{ 'archive' | relative_url }}), and [example page]({{ 'about' | relative_url }}))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

[Check out]({% post_url 2024-11-06-example-content %}) what example content looks like in the theme and learn what [features]({% post_url 2024-11-07-features %}) are available.

## Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), Firefox, and Edge.

## Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
