Gruv Poole inherits the same bare-bones features of the original [Poole theme](https://github.com/poole/poole): Namely light and dark mode support and a best-in-class set of CSS variables to enable further customization.

- toc
{: toc }

## Dark mode

**Dark mode is enabled automatically** via [CSS media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) dependent on what the user's system preference is set as. The `_sass/_variables.scss` stylesheet contains all of the variables in order to easily tweak colors of the site's theme.
> Google Chrome's devtools can switch between light and dark preferences if you're tweaking for your own needs 

Code syntax highlighting also supports light and dark modes. The `_sass/_syntax.css` stylesheet was ported from the output of [Rouge's Gruvbox class](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rouge/Rouge/Themes/Gruvbox).

## Color palette

Gruv Poole was directly inspired by the [Gruvbox Hugo theme](https://hugo-theme-gruvbox.schnerring.net) and by extension, the original [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), the retro groove color scheme for Vim.

Gruvbox's color palette has been faithfully ported over into CSS variables for seamless usage in web development. These can be found in the well-documented `_sass/_variables.scss` stylesheet.

## Google Analytics

Specify `google_analytics` in your `_config.yml` and restart the server to add Google Analytics tracking code (production environment only).

```ruby
# Google Analytics example
google_analytics: UA-000000-0
```
