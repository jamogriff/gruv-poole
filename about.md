Typeface design is a fascinating skill-set with a ton of heritage, so Gruv Poole has included dedicated typefaces. [Jost](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) was chosen for the body font and [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro) for the code snippets.
They are both licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/), and their licenses can be found [here]({{ 'assets/fonts/body/LICENSE.md' | relative_url }}) and [here]({{ 'assets/fonts/code/LICENSE.md' | relative_url }}).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

- Built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Coded with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with the [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) color scheme (sorry Gruvbox!)
